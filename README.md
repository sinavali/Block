# Block

Block is envisioned as an open source Node.js package (for TypeScript) that will provide a modular, block-based approach to building applications. Inspired by systems like Minecraft, Block will let developers write single-purpose function files ("blocks"), register them via a JSON configuration, and then compose them visually into complete applications.

---

## What Block Will Be

- **Modular Function Blocks:**  
  Each block is a standalone function file (with its filename matching the block name) that you can write and test in isolation. The blocks will be registered through a simple JSON file containing metadata (like file path and inputs/outputs).

- **Visual Composition Tool:**  
  A BPMN-like frontend will allow project managers to drag, drop, and connect blocks—determining the application flow—after which the system will generate and compile the complete code.

- **TypeScript-First:**  
  Block is being built as a Node.js package exclusively for TypeScript (with plans to support other scripting languages in the future).

- **CLI Integration:**  
  A command-line interface will help manage block registration, testing, and code generation.
